# DeviationCalculator
This website shows you the steps needed to solve for the standard deviation of a set of numbers, as well as the mean and median.

The calculator can handle integers and decimal values.

The user even has the choice of selecting population or sample standard deviation using radio buttons.

The website uses **MathJax** to take advantage of LaTex math notation to beautifly display the equations.
